      <div class="about-content">
        <p class="txt">I am a proud Canadian born and raised in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. In 2017 I graduated from the
          University of Winnipeg with a BSc in Applied Computer Science.</p>
        <p  class="txt">During the year of 2017 I continued to work on my programming skills. Realizing my passion for web development and
        design, I decided to earn a tech degree online through TeamTreeHouse.com. I finished the course and obtained
        certification as a Fullstack Developer.</p>
        <p  class="txt">Shortly after Graduating during the year of 2017, I began working as a freelancer. I was fortunate and lucky to land
        myself with a medium sized client. They are a non-profit organization that represents all medical students across Canada
        named the Canadian Federation of Medical Students. My good friend Pavel was doing some work for the CFMS, helping with
        their website while he was in his first year of Medicine. The project ended up becoming too large for Pavel to maintain
        by himself. The CFMS emailed me a Request for Proposal. I put together a project proposal and with Pavel’s mentorship
        and recommendation, I landed my first Freelance Client!</p>
        <p  class="txt">During May of 2018, I was applying at a few places and interviewing with a few companies. I ended up receiving a couple
        offers, but in the end I was drawn towards the offer I received from Bold Commerce. I started my role as a developer with them around June
        11th. I have continued to freelance while working as Bold. The company supports entrepreneurs. This was one thing I
        really liked, which lead me to taking their offer. They specialize within ECommerce, so I never take on any ECommerce
        work to avoid a conflict of interest. I feel so grateful to have found Bold Commerce as a place of employment. </p>

        <p class="quote-text text-center"><span class="opening">❝</span>My workweek always seems to fly by as I love the work I am
          doing with my team!<span class="closing">❞</span></p>

        <p  class="txt">In my personal life, I discovered my love for physical activity. I also realized it is a healthy way to combat stress. I
        learned about weight lifting and exercise through a family member, who took the time to mentor me and helped me to
        develop a balanced exercise and diet. I will always be grateful for that! My exercise routine has become part of a
        healthy lifestyle for me, and I have since been able to share my experience with others.</p>
        <p  class="txt">I also enjoy playing piano. In my spare time I from time to time try to learn challenging solo pieces. My current
        favorite composer is Nobuo Uematsu. I have competed in Tauber music festivals, and enjoy performing for friends and
        family.</p>
        <p  class="txt">Whether at the gym or online, I have found that communicating and collaborating with others has helped me to better
        myself, my life, and my skills. I look forward to the next new challenge to come! </p>
          <br>
