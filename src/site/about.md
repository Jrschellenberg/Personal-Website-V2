I am a proud Canadian born and raised in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. In 2017 I graduated from the University of Winnipeg with a BSc in Applied Computer Science.

During the year of 2017 I continued to work on my programming skills. Realizing my passion for web development and design, I decided to earn a tech degree online through TeamTreeHouse.com. I finished the course and obtained certification as a Fullstack Developer.

Shortly after Graduating during the year of 2017, I began working as a freelancer. I was fortunate and lucky to land myself with a medium sized client. They are a non-profit organization that represents all medical students across Canada named the [Canadian Federation of Medical Students.](https://cfms.org){:target="_blank"} My good friend Pavel was doing some work for the CFMS, helping with their website while he was in his first year of Medicine. The project ended up becoming too large to maintain by himself. The CFMS emailed me a Request for Proposal. I put together an estimate and with Pavel's mentorship and recommendation, I landed my first Freelance Client!
 
I spent most of my time during the rest of 2017 into early 2018 ensuring that I delivered my tasks on time. The Estimate was broken into roughly 50 sub-tasks. Each task was tracked and maintained as their own git issue.

During around March of 2018, the project with the CFMS
 
In 2013 I became involved in the cryptocurrency community, and began building and maintaining my first mining rig. The technology interested me at the time, but I treated it more like a hobby and learning opportunity. More recently, with the rise in cryptocurrency popularity, my interest has been rekindled, in part because there are many more people to collaborate with! I have recently enrolled in an online course called Learn Python by Building a Blockchain & Cryptocurrency to improve my skills. In addition, I have become involved with several new cryptocurrency projects, collaborating with people from all over the globe. My most recent project is the creation of web based code for a Masternode based community coin. ETA for launch is Q3 of 2018.

I also enjoy playing piano. In my spare time I learn challenging solo pieces; my current favorite composer is Nobuo Uematsu. I have competed in Tauber music festivals, and enjoy performing for friends and family.

Life is exciting and full of opportunities, but new challenges go hand in hand with new stresses! Three years ago, I discovered that physical activity was a healthy way to combat stress. I learned about weight lifting and exercise through a family member, who took the time to mentor me and helped me to develop a balanced exercise and diet regimen. I will always be grateful for that! My exercise routine has become part of a healthy lifestyle for me, and I have since been able to share my experience with others.

Whether at the gym or online, I have found that communicating and collaborating with others has helped me to better myself, my life, and my skills. I look forward to the next new challenge to come!
